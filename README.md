John Lemon's Haunted Jaunt - Unity Game Starter Project
Welcome to my GitHub repository for John Lemon's Haunted Jaunt, a 3D endless runner game that I created as part of my university coursework.

About the Game
In this game, you play as John Lemon, a character who's stuck in a haunted castle and has to escape from it. The player controls John as he runs through the castle's different environments, jumping over obstacles and dodging traps to make his way to the exit.

Project Overview
This game was built using the Unity game engine, and features a number of mechanics that were implemented using C# scripts. Some of the main features of the game include:

Endless runner gameplay mechanics
3D environment and character design
Obstacle avoidance and trap dodging
Power-ups to help the player progress
Scoring system with high-score tracking
Installation Instructions
To run the game, you will need to have the Unity game engine installed on your computer. Once you have the engine installed, you can simply download this repository and open the project in Unity. From there, you can build the game to your desired platform (PC, mobile, etc.) and run it to play.
